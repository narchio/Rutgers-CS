## Note: 
I am a full stack software engineer. I have had many experiences in the industry already through my school work and internships building products. Below is a course which focused specifically on real-world Software Engineering. 

  ###### CS 213 - Building Desktop/Mobile Apps with Java  
      - Song Library and Photo Library apps for desktop  
      - Chess game for desktop and mobile (andriod)  
      - Written in Java, developed on both JavaFx and Android Studio, respectively
        
I am facinated with Artificial Intelligence, especially in the areas of Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Below are direct courses/projects that relate to these topics that I have done during my undergraduate coursework.

  ###### CS 440 (AI) - Machine Learning 
      - Astar and Repeated Forward Astar search algorithms
      - Image Classifier 
      
   ###### CS 425/525 (Brain) - 3rd generation Machine Learning and Spiking Neural Networks
      - Creating neurons that spike based on certain inputs with three different neuron models. 
      - Building 2 Spiking Neural Networks: 
        - Creating an XOR gate with spiking neurons
        - Creating line detector neurons 


### Stay tuned for all my new updates while I pursue my M.Eng in CS at Cornell!
